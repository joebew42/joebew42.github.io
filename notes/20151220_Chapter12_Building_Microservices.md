# Bringing It All together

## Principles of Microservice

- Modeled around business concepts
- Culture of automation
- Hide internal implementation details
- Highly observable
- Decentralize all the things
- Deploy independently
- Isolate failure

## When Shouldn't You Use Microservices ?

### The monolithic system

If you are coming to a monolithic system for which you don't understand
domain, try to spend some time in learning what the system does, and then
try to identify clean module boundaries prior to splitting up services.

### The Greenfield development

Consider starting monolithic first and break things out when you're stable.
