# A clean software architecture

## Main questions

- What our software actually does ?

    through explicit verbs, Action(s)

- What our software is about ?

    through nouns, Model(s) and Domain Service(s)

- How do we expose the features of our system ?

    through a Delivery Mechanism(s)

## What about the structure of the application?

We generally observe two main concepts that emerges from an
application:

- The business model
- The delivery mechanism

### The business model

The first concept tell us about the business model of our application,
what is the behaviour of our application? What are the actions that we
can invoke on it? And what are the entities? And how them collaborates
each other?

- Action(s), Domain Service(s) and Model(s) goes here.

### The delivery mechanism

The second concept tell us how we expose the application to the
outside world, and how we control the workflow. A business model can
have more than one delivery mechanism.

## What about the Hexagonal Architecture or Ports and Adapters pattern?

Yes, basically we are talking about the same thing.

## How our application can be structured in a real life example ?

src/
   /core          <---- The business model
      /models     <---- What our software is about
      /actions    <---- What our software actually does
   /web           <---- An HTTP delivery mechanism based on a REST API
   /cl            <---- A command line delivery mechanism

## An example of an outside-in interaction workflow

Controller -> Action -> Domain Service -> Repository
                                       -> Entity

### What are Action, Domain Service and Entity about ?

- Action

  Defines the action our domain model will be asked to perform

- Domain Service

  Behaviour related to a group of entitiies

- Entity

  Behaviour related to the data of a single entity

### What we can observe ?

What does our system           ------------->  How does our system

Higher number of collaborators ------------->  Few or no collaborators

Behaviour is determined by
  the interaction with         ------------->  No interaction
    collaborators

  We should use Mocks          ------------->  No mocks

In general, the more outside we are the more the high-level behaviour
is expressed through clear actions (e.g. CreateNewUser, MakeNewOrder,
MakePayment, etc ...). On the other hand, the more inside we are the
more low-level behaviour is expresses through concrete classes
implementation (e.g. MongoDBUserRepository,
ElastiSearchProductsSearchIndex, etc ...)

## Interaction workflow helps us to define a Design workflow

Here the name IDD (Interaction Driven Design) comes, because once we
have an explicit and well-defined "Interaction Workflow" that follows
an outside-in approach, we can use it as guide line to design our
software.

### Interaction workflow

```
                     /--> Domain Service --> Repository
Controller -> Action
                     \--> Entity
```

### Design workflow (an outside-in approach)

0. A 'user story' can me mapped with an action

1. Start to understand how our software communicates with the external
   world. This helps us to bring out the role (interface) of the
   'Action'; What are the inputs ? What are the outputs ?

2. Once the 'Action' is there we can start to understand how the
   action is supposed to performs its operations: Whare are its
   collaborators (e.g. domain services, entities) ? How is supposed
   its collaborators behave (interface/role discovery) ?

3. Once domain services or entities are discovered we can start
   develop on them (maybe new collaborators such as Repository will
   emerge in this phase.)

# What our software is about ?

Our software is about entities that interacts one each other, we can
express them by nouns, e.g. models/product, models/book, models/order,
etc ... Or more specific, if needed, e.g. models/products/toy,
models/products/cellphone, etc ...

# Where do I have to look to know what our software actually does ?

We can better express what our software does by making explicit the
actions which we can be performed on our system, with verbs (e.g.
actions/makeOrder, actions/createUser, actions/updateOrder, etc ...)

# Technical concerns about third party libraries integration

This is a kind of topic that has no valuable information regarding the
business, so, we are likely to push them all in a dedicated bucket
that we should call "infrastructure", some example:

infrastructure/repository/MysqlUserRepository
infrastructure/payments/PayPalPaymentGateway
