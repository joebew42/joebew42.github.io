Hello all! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Joe,

<img alt="profile photo" src="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1238549?v=4&s=180" class="center" />

Glad to see you landed on this personal space of mine. Welcome to some of my thoughts, experiments and experiences about _Software Development_, _Tools_ and _Creative Processes_ that I am going to share with you.

### Few words about me ...

Currently I am working as Team Lead  [@DerivcoSports](https://twitter.com/DerivcoSports), Sweden. Previously, Agile Software Developer and Technical Trainer [@XPeppers](https://twitter.com/xpeppers), Italy.

I am interested in the discipline of [Clean Code and Agile](https://github.com/joebew42/study-path)[^1]. If you feel yourself interested in learning and practice more about these topics, please feel free to write me an email! It will be a joy to schedule a session with you.

You can catch me on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/joebew42) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEt-X-5yZ86SYTNDbSQgVAQ), where sometimes I do live coding sessions or share videos about programming. I also tend to organize or join local meetups about Agile Software Development. Rarely, attend conferences.

Here is my [Daily Activity Log](http://joebew42.github.io/events.xml), where I share what I am reading, studying or watching! You can even [grab the RSS format](https://daily2rss.herokuapp.com/rss/?url=http://joebew42.github.io/events) - _oh the good and old one_ - if you have an RSS Reader.

[^1]: This is an ambitious learning path about Software Development. The goal is to have a well-organized place where people can refer to when comes to read about _Software Design Principles_, _Test-Driven Design_, _Refactoring_, _Working With Legacy Code_, _Domain-Driven Design_, and _Microservices_.
