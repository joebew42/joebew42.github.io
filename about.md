Hello folks!

My name is Joe Bew, I am currently working as an [Agile Software Developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) at [XPeppers](http://www.xpeppers.com/) where I deal with [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/), [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) and [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).

I like to keep the focus on the practices that we can apply during everyday work that enables us to save time, be more productive, build better products and make the team happier.

## How am I used to work ?

I prefer to play and work with people, as a team. Better if we where in the same workplace.

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) plays an important role during my typical work day. It helps me to stay focused on the current activity I am working on, to reduce distractions or interruptions and to keep tracks of the effort required to complete a task, with the outcome that at the end of my day I have a clear picture of what I have done, and a measure of the effective time spent on a particular activity, that I may use as feedback to improve the way I organize my next day's activities schedule.

**When I am at writing code** I am used to combine the practice of test-driven development with the disciplined pace driven by the pomodoro technique, so that I can leverage on this regulated way to work without the need to rush.

I like to practice [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) cause I strongly believe that an active and constant feedback loop is even much better and effective for the overall outcome quality instead of the old technical review or other feedback process that starts only after the work has been committed.

Being an Agile software developer encourages me to be more interested in the practices rather than tools. Tools like programming languages changes over the time. Improving the mastery of [XP practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices) let me to easily adapt to the change.

## Topics that I am finding of interest

You can follow my studies by visiting my [Daily Activity Log](http://joebew42.github.io/events.xml).

## Side activities

* A [study path](https://github.com/joebew42/study-path) about several topics about software development that you may find helpful for your career. I am trying to keep it up to date with my studies.

* If you have some experiences with [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), you could be interested in joining [Mobos](https://github.com/mobos/mob). Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to ensure constant development on the project, so I can not guarantee when it will be available and usable, but I am always available to welcome people who want to contribute or want to know more about.

* A [Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/joebew42) where sometimes I go live with programming session about teaching, exercising or contributing on opensource projects. You can read more about my journey on Twitch by reading the [official journal](https://joebew42.github.io/twitch/).

* A [funny initiative](http://shittysomething.com/) to summarize our daily moods! Check it out, and if sometimes you feel like a _"shitty coder"_, please let me know by [issuing a pull request](https://github.com/ShittySomething/shittysomething.github.io)!
