Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

It's Joe, an **Agile Practioner and Technical Coach**, currently in the role of Team Leader  [@DerivcoSports](https://twitter.com/DerivcoSports), Sweden. Previously, Agile Software Developer and Technical Trainer [@XPeppers](https://twitter.com/xpeppers), Italy.

I am interested in [Clean Code and Agile](https://github.com/joebew42/study-path), and all other practices that can lead to a sustainable way of writing software, and I do really enjoy to share this passion with others, where I can. I am always looking to learn, explore and experiment new ideas.

You can find me on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/joebew42), or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEt-X-5yZ86SYTNDbSQgVAQ) where I sometimes share videos about programming.

I also tend to organize or join local meetups about Agile Software Development.

Here is my [Daily Activity Log](http://joebew42.github.io/events.xml), where I share what I am reading, studying or watching! You can even [grab the RSS format](https://daily2rss.herokuapp.com/rss/?url=http://joebew42.github.io/events) - _oh the good and old one_ - if you have an RSS Reader.
