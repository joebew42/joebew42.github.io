Hello folks!

My name is Joe Bew, I am currently working as an [Agile Software Developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) at [XPeppers](http://www.xpeppers.com/) where I deal with [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/), [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) and [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), with the aim to help customers build better products.

Right now I am going in depth with [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), [Microservices Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html), [Distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) and [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/). You can follow my studies by visiting my [Daily Activity Log](http://joebew42.github.io/events.xml).

Besides the mainly technical aspects I like to pay particular attention to the improvement of organizational aspects, dynamics, trainings and soft skills that are the growth's pillars of a team and its culture.

## How am I used to work ?

I prefer to play and work with people, as a team. Better if we where in the same workplace.

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) plays an important role during my typical work day. It helps me to keep tracks of the effort required to complete a task of the day, with the outcome that at the end of my day I have a clear picture of what I have done, and a measure of the effective time spent on a particular activity, that I may use as feedback to improve the way I organize my next day's activities schedule.

Combining the practice of test-driven development with the disciplined pace driven by the pomodoro technique, I can leverage on this quite mechanical way to work without the need to rush.

I like to practice [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming), besides the old technical review or other feedback process that starts only after the work has been committed, I am strongly convinced that an active and a constant feedback loop is even much better and effective for the overall outcome quality.

Being an agile software developer encourages me to be more interested in the practices rather than tools. Tools like programming languages changes over the time. Improving the mastery of [xp practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices) let me to easily adapt to the change.

## Side activities

* A [study path](https://github.com/joebew42/study-path) about several topics about software development that you may find helpful for your career. I am trying to keep it up to date with my studies.

* If you have some experiences with [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), you could be interested in joining [Mobos](https://github.com/mobos/mob). Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to ensure constant development on the project, so I can not guarantee when it will be available and usable, but I am always available to welcome people who want to contribute or want to know more about.

* A [Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/joebew42) where sometimes I go live with programming session about teaching, exercising or contributing on opensource projects. All sessions are accessible on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEt-X-5yZ86SYTNDbSQgVAQ).

* With some of my collegues we started this [funny initiative](http://shittysomething.com/) in order to summarize our daily moods! Check it out, and if sometimes you feel like a shitty coder, please let we know by [issuing a pull request](https://github.com/ShittySomething/shittysomething.github.io)!


## Other stuffs

* I have a [GitHub](https://github.com/joebew42) account that I use to share notes, pet projects or some spikes.
* I like videogames
* I like food
