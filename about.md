Hi there! :wave:

Glad to see you on my personal blog and welcome to some of my thoughts, experiments and experiences about _Software Development_, _Tools_ and _Creative Process_.

### My name is Joe,

I am a Software Professional and Technical Trainer, focused on Software Design Principles and Practices:

- Clean Code
- Test-Driven Development
- Refactoring
- Legacy Code
- Domain-Driven Design

During my work experiences I had the chance to meet great people and challenging work environments that encouraged me to learn, practice, understand, and explore better ways of doing Software Development.

I like to help people understand the underlying principles of Software Design and the practices that might be used to keep the process of writing software as much sustainable as possible.

My current goal is to become better at Software Development, and share what I learn with others.

> I do believe people comes before anything else. Successful teams, organizations and products are just symptoms of an healthy culture where people are given high Trust, Transparency, Autonomy, and Significance. The Motivation will follow.
