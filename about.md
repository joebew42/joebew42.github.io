# Hello there! :wave:

My name is Joe, I am a computer programmer and technical trainer, focused on software design principles and practices of software development:

- Clean Code
- Test-Driven Development
- Refactoring
- Legacy Code
- Domain-Driven Design

When I am NOT at writing code, I enjoy to:

- Play video games :video_game:
- Read books :books:
- Walk :walking: or run :running:

I like to learn new things, explore new ideas and share what I do with others.

> I do believe people comes before anything else. Successful teams, organizations and products are just symptoms of an healthy culture where people are given high Trust, Transparency, Autonomy, and Significance. The Motivation will follow.
