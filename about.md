Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

It's Joe, an **Agile Practioner**, currently in the role of Team Leader / Technical Coach [@DerivcoSports](https://twitter.com/DerivcoSports) Sweden. We do Pair Programming, TDD, fight Legacy code bases, use the Pomodoro Technique, and **try to accommodate new business requirements in a fast changing environment**.

Previously, Agile Software Developer and Technical Trainer [@XPeppers](https://twitter.com/xpeppers).

I am interested in [Clean Code and Agile](https://github.com/joebew42/study-path), and all other practices that can lead to a sustainable way of writing software. I am always looking to learn, explore and experiment new ideas.

Sometimes you can find me on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/joebew42), or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEt-X-5yZ86SYTNDbSQgVAQ) where I share videos about programming. Usually I participate or organize local meetups about Agile Software Development.

I prefer to use [Free and Open Source Software](https://www.fsf.org/).

Here is my [Daily Activity Log](http://joebew42.github.io/events.xml), where I share what I am reading, studying or watching! You can even [grab the RSS format](https://daily2rss.herokuapp.com/rss/?url=http://joebew42.github.io/events) - _oh the good and old one_ - if you have an RSS Reader.
