Hello all! ðŸ‘‹

Glad to see you on my personal blog and welcome to some of my thoughts, experiments and experiences about _Software Development_, _Tools_ and _Creative Process_.

### My name is Joe,

I am based in Stockholm, Sweden, where I work as a Software Developer and Technical Trainer.

During my work experience, I was fortunate enough to meet challenging work environments and great people that allowed me to learn, practice, understand and follow agile and eXtreme programming principles to find better ways of doing Software Development.

My current focus is to become a better Software Developer, and share what I learn about Lean, Design Thinking, Agile, and Software Craftsmanship with others.

> I do believe people comes before anything else. Successful teams, organizations and products are just symptoms of an healthy culture where people are given high Trust, Transparency, Autonomy, and Significance. The Motivation will follow.

### Keep in touch

You can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joebew42), or an email at `joebew42 [at] gmail.com`.

I am also on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/joebew42) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEt-X-5yZ86SYTNDbSQgVAQ), where sometimes I do live coding sessions or share videos about programming. All of my code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/joebew42).

If you want to do pair programming with me, and share experience on:

- Code Kata (practice on SOLID, Clean Code, TDD, Refactoring, Legacy Code)
- Contribution on open source projects
- Learning new programming languages and tools
- Chit-chat on methods of software development.

Feel free to contact me. I will be glad to book a session with you.
