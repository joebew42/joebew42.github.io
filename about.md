Hello all! ðŸ‘‹

<img alt="profile photo" src="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1238549?v=4&s=180" class="center" />

Glad to see you on my personal blog and welcome to some of my thoughts, experiments and experiences about _Software Development_, _Tools_ and _Creative Process_ that I am going to share with you.

### Few words about me ...

My name is Joe,

I am currently based in Stockholm, Sweden, where I work as Software Developer. I am in love with Lean, Design Thinking, Agile and Software Craftsmanship.

> I do believe people comes before anything else. Successful teams, organizations and products are just symptoms of an healthy culture where people are given high Trust, Transparency, Autonomy, and Significance. The Motivation will follow.
