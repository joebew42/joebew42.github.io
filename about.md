Hello folks!

I am Joe Bew, an [Agile Software Developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) that currently live and work in [Trento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trento), Italy, at [XPeppers](http://www.xpeppers.com/).

I was born in Calabria, where I attended secondary school in [Catanzaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catanzaro) and then completed my studies with a degree in Computer Science at [UNICAL](http://www.unical.it/) in [Cosenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosenza). There I spent a lot of time in supporting [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) activities with my fellows at [HackLab Cosenza](http://hlcs.it/) and [HackLab Catanzaro](http://hacklab.cz/). I will always be grateful to them for the great opportunity they have given me in making me understand and investigate many technical topics.

After my studies I started to work as Computer Programmer (mainly Java, Python and PHP), also as Linux System Administrator (Apache Web Servers and Mail Server).

In 2012 I started a Master in Computer Science in Trento, [University of Trento](http://www.unitn.it/en), that I never completed.

In 2013 I met XPeppers where I started to learn a lot about [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/), [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) and [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). In my spare time I have tried to collect and organize a [study path](https://github.com/joebew42/study-path) about different topics on software development that you may find helpful for your career.

My [Daily Activity Log](http://joebew42.github.io/events.xml) is helping me to keep track of my studies. Feel free to read it every time you want to know what I am studying/doing.
