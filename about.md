# Hello there! :wave:

I am Joe, programmer and agile practitioner, focused on software design principles and practices of software development.

When I am not coding, I enjoy playing video games, reading books or going for a walk.

I like to learn new things, explore new ideas and share what I do with others.

> I do believe people comes before anything else. Successful teams, organizations and products are just symptoms of an healthy culture where people are given high Trust, Transparency, Autonomy, and Significance. The Motivation will follow.
