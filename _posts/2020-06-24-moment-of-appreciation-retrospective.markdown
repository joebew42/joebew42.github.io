<!--more-->

The **purpose of this retrospective** is to help the team to gather as much information as possible about the sprint (or iteration), to clearly visualize the most relevant facts that have concerned the sprint, and to have a better ground to think of which topics will be likely highlight later, during the retrospective.

If you are wondering **when is it suitable to run a retrospective like this**, I will be glad to provide my suggestion, and based on my personal experience I would recommend you, and your team, to **try out this format in these circumstances**:

- The team is already familiar with the Lean Coffee format. [^1]
- Retrospectives happens on Monday (or on the first day of the working week). [^2]

## The format

Yes, this retrospective is **"100% remote-friendly"**. It works really well on remote teams.

The picture shows an instant of the retrospective, and a brief description of all stages. Consider taking some time, open the image at its full size, and take a look at it.

The **time duration** for this retrospective is 1 hour or less.

You can prepare a physical board, or using a digital one (like Trello or Miro), with all the needed areas, and try to better highlight them.

I have not tried yet, but an idea might be to have two physical boards, one for the **Information Gathering**, and another for the **Lean Coffee**.

<!-- Here we will go through each of the phase (or section) of the retrospective: -->
## The structure

The format is structured around three different subsequent stages:

- Information Gathering
- Lean Coffee
- Agree on an Action

### Information Gathering :information_source:

- **The previous retrospective action** :heavy_check_mark: (few minutes)<br/>
  The team, or the people in charge of the previous action, will provide a brief update of it.
- **A moment of appreciation** :pray: (~8 minutes)<br/>
  It is an exercise that each member of the team has to do. Trying to figure out a few words of appreciation for the people or facts that were very helpful for the success of the sprint.
- **What I did not like** :thumbsdown: (~8 minutes)<br/>
  Each team member will write down all the things they didn't find of any value for the sprint.
- **What I liked!** :thumbsup: (~8 minutes)<br/>
  Each team member will write down all the things they liked during the sprint. Everything that was valuable for the sprint.

### Lean Coffee :coffee:

- The whole team will take a few minutes to review the information previously gathered.
- Start the Lean Coffee (~25 minutes)

### Agree on an Action :heavy_check_mark:

- Find an action based on the topics discussed (5 minutes)

## Conclusion and learnings ...

That's all, folks!

I hope you will give this retrospective a chance and try it out in your team, and I am curious to listen your feedback, what worked, what not and what you think could be improved in this format.

After having run this retrospective format for a couple of times, I think I learned that creating a dedicated room to gather the appreciations is a very powerful tool. It is always nice to remember and recognize that our work is driven by people, and give or receive sincere appreciation is a good way to:

- Understand **what others have appreciated**.
- Understand **what are the habits we should preserve, or do more of**.
- Having a starting ground to **reassemble the relevant facts of the sprint**.
