> We seldom pay attention to the people behind the facts, and at how much important the presence of a colleague was, during the sprint. Retrospectives might be perfect to highlight appreciations for our colleagues. Here I will describe a format with the purpose to help your team to do so!

<!--more-->

The **purpose of this retrospective** is to help the team to gather as much information as possible about the sprint (or iteration), to clearly visualize the most relevant facts that have concerned the sprint, and to have a better ground to think of which topics will be likely highlight later, during the retrospective.

If you are wondering **when is it suitable to run a retrospective like this**, I will be glad to provide my suggestion, and based on my personal experience I would recommend you, and your team, to **try out this format in these circumstances**:

- The team is already familiar with the Lean Coffee format. [^1]
- Retrospectives happens on Monday (or on the first day of the working week). [^2]

## The format

If your team satisfies all the circumstances mentioned above, it's time to dive into the format of this retrospective, and in the following section, I will describe how to set up this format, all the phases, and the time duration.

So, yes, this retrospective is **"100% remote-friendly"**. It works really well on remote teams.

_This was one of the retrospective we experimented with this format. Trello did a good job. Click on the image to access the full size._

The picture shows an instant of the retrospective, and a brief description of all stages. Consider taking some time, open the image at its full size, and take a look at it.

The **time duration** for this retrospective is 1 hour or less.

In order to set up this retrospective and have everything ready, you can prepare a physical board, or using a digital one (like Trello or Miro), with all the needed areas, and try to better highlight them.

I have not tried yet, but an idea might be to have two physical boards, one for the **information gathering**, and another for the **Lean Coffee**.

The phases or areas:

- **Information Gathering** :information_source:
    - _The previous retrospective action_ :heavy_check_mark: (few minutes)
        - The team, or the people in charge of the previous action, will provide a brief update of it.
    - _A moment of appreciation_ :pray: (~8 minutes)
        - It is an exercise that each member of the team has to do. Trying to figure out a few words of appreciation for the people or facts that were very helpful for the success of the sprint.
    - _What I did not like_ :thumbsdown: (~8 minutes)
        - Each team member will write down all the things they didn't find of any value for the sprint.
    - _What I liked!_ :thumbsup: (~8 minutes)
        - Each team member will write down all the things they liked during the sprint. Everything that was valuable for the sprint.
- **Lean Coffee** :coffee:
    - The whole team will take a few minutes to review the information previously gathered.
    - Start the Lean Coffee (~25 minutes)
- **Agree on an Action** :heavy_check_mark:
    - Find an action based on the topics discussed (5 minutes)

That's it, folks!

I hope you will give this retrospective a chance and try it out in your team. I am always curious to receive feedback based on your experience, what worked, what not and what you think could be improved in this format.

## What I think I have learned

Creating a dedicated room to gather the appreciations is a very powerful tool. It is always nice to remember and recognize that our work is driven by people, and give or receive sincere appreciation is a good way to:
- Understand **what others have appreciated**.
- Understand **what are the habits we should preserve, or do more of**.
- Having a starting ground the **reassemble the relevant facts of the sprint**.
