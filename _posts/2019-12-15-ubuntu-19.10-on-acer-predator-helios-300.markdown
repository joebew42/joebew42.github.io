_Ubuntu 19.10 on Acer Predator Helios 300_

Long story short, I finally decided to buy a new laptop.

The choice is [Acer Predator Helios 300](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Predator-i7-9750H-Keyboard-PH315-52-78VL/dp/B07QXLFLXT):

- Monitor: 15.6 inches Full HD 144Hz 3ms IPS Display
- CPU: Intel i7-9750H
- Video: GTX 1660 Ti 6GB
- RAM: 16GB DDR4
- SSD: 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD

Yes, it is a gaming laptop, that [I will mainly use to write code, video editing, remote pair programming and sometimes to do live coding sessions](https://twitter.com/joebew42/status/1188143433371836416) on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/joebew42).

My preferred operating system is GNU/Linux and unfortunately, this laptop comes with Windows 10. Argh!

Let's install Ubuntu 19.10!

## Installing Ubuntu 19.10

Yes, it works!

My previous OS was Arch Linux, this time I decided to switch to Ubuntu 19.10 (easy to install, ready-to-go.)

Steps I followed to install Ubuntu 19.10:

### 1. Download [Ubuntu 19.10 Desktop](http://releases.ubuntu.com/19.10/)

### 2. Create a USB Bootable Flash Drive:

`dd if=~/Downloads/ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M`

_In my case the flash drive was attached to /dev/sdb._

### 3. Change BIOS settings of the Acer Predator Helios 300

- Turn the laptop on.
- At boot press `F2` and enter the BIOS Setup.
- Go to the `security` tab and set the BIOS Password (this is needed for the next step.)
- Go to the `boot` tab and disable the `Secure Boot`.
- Go to the `system` tab and switch `RST Premium Mode` to `AHCI Mode` (this will allow the Ubuntu Installer to recognize the SSD).
- Save the changes, press `F10` and reboot.

### 4. Install Ubuntu 19.10

- Insert the USB Flash Drive
- While the computer is booting press `F12`
- Choose `Try Ubuntu without installing (safe graphics)`
- Once Ubuntu is started, be sure you have an Internet connection (so that during the installation process it will fetch all the updates)
- Press the icon `Install` (remember to check the boxes to install the third-party and proprietaries drivers, they are needed for the NVIDIA video card.)
- **I removed all the Windows related partitions, and decided to have only Ubuntu on this laptop, no dual-boot. So, from this point proceed at your own risk!**
- Once the installation is over, just restart the laptop :)

### 5. Post installation steps

I noticed that the laptop **doesn't wake up quickly, after suspend**.

Some strange messages from the `dmesg` says:

```
...
[10353.568820] Restarting tasks ... done.
[10353.578325] PM: Possible incorrect RTC due to pm_trace, please use 'ntpdate' or 'rdate' to reset it.
[10353.638335] PM: suspend exit
```

After [installing `chrony`](https://vitux.com/keep-your-clock-sync-with-internet-time-servers-in-ubuntu/), everything seems fixed:

`sudo apt-get install chrony`

But the **touchpad is not working after suspend!** What!?

After playing for a while with `modprobe`, I discovered that:

```
sudo modprobe -vr i2c_hid
sudo modprobe -v i2c_hid
```

Did the trick! Touchpad working again :)

There should be the way to automate this step when the laptop wakes up after the suspend, but I need to learn more about that. If you know how, please let me know.

### 6. Enjoy!

Everything seems fine! If you find something new or wants to add more information, contact me on Twitter [`@joebew42`](https://twitter.com/joebew42).
