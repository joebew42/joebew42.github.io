> The approach of Themed Groups briefly explained.

The full article of the approach is available here: [Themed Groups: A dynamic way to respond to real and timely needs]({% post_url 2025-05-01-themed-groups %}).

## Essence

Themed Groups are dynamic, cross-functional teams formed in full autonomy to address specific, timely needs within an organization. Unlike traditional static communities, these groups are temporary, diverse, and outcome-focused, and disbanded once their goals are met.

Themed Groups are lightweight and purely optional, their adoption do not require the current organization structure to change: they are a thin layer of a structure that appears and disappears strategically, when the needs of the moment would require it.

Themed Groups seek for clear team ownership, to prevent initiatives from starting and ending in a limbo, in that gray area that no one owns.

In the next part I will try to break down the key phases of the life cycle of themed groups.

## The Lifecyle of a Themed Group

1. **Identifying the Need:** A real and timely need requires attention.
2. **Group Formation:**  People with relevant skills and perspectives come together organically to address the identified need. Having a "sponsor" team onboard is important at this stage. The sponsor is the team that will take the ownership of the initative if that would require more work and follow up.
3. **Storming:** All the people involved works together to reach well-informed consensus for a quick solution to address the specific need.
4. **Disbanding:** Once the group has done exploring, finding or implementing a quick solution, the group is disbanded.

## F.A.Q.

**Themed Groups are short-lived, how short?**

I have never seen such approach applied in a real-world scenario, so I cannot give concrete examples, but in my view I would expect a themed group to **live for a minimum of a few hours to no more than a week**.
