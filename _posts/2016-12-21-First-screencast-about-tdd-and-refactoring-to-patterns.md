Today I officialy launched my **[twitch account](https://www.twitch.tv/joebew42)** with a first screencast about [TDD and Refactoring to patterns](https://www.twitch.tv/joebew42/v/108916836). The aim of my twitch account is to share live sessions about programming, clean code, TDD, refactoring and whatever with you folks.

All screencasts recorded live on Twitch are automatically exported to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEt-X-5yZ86SYTNDbSQgVAQ) too. So if you are more comfortable with YouTube you can see all my screencasts there.

You'll find the code of this screencast on [GitHub](https://github.com/joebew42/fizzbuzzkata)

## The screencast
