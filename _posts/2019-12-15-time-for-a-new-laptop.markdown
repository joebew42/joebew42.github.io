The time has arrived and after almost seven years of really well served time of my previous laptop [^1], I finally decided to buy a new one. It's an [Acer Predator Helios 300](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Predator-i7-9750H-Keyboard-PH315-52-78VL/dp/B07QXLFLXT), a gaming laptop which I will not use to play videogames. So, why this decision?

There are several reasons that led me to end up with this decision.

First of all, I think at my [adventure on Twitch](https://joebew42.github.io/twitch/about). It had an important weight to this decision, and I really enjoyed the experience of Live Coding on Twitch, and sooner or later I will resume it!

Other reason is because I started to create few screencasts about [Clean Coding, TDD and Refactoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmoLmjirmTk) (more creations are expected to come in the future), and I would like to continue to follow this idea to create more contents (as live code streaming sessions, more screencasts, and even complete video series) about the discipline of Clean Code.

Apart from all of this, it's also my intention to schedule periodic Pair Programming sessions with you all (_so, if you are interested in doing pair programming with me, please contact me_).

And last but not least, I want to develop few ideas into real products. Yes, I will create few products of my own. It's a new journey for me, I will use this blog post to share experiences, experiments behind the creation of new products; the process I followed to make an idea into reality, the failures and the learnings.

Here will follow the story about the [installation process of Ubuntu 19.10 as a replacement for Windows]({% post_url 2019-12-18-ubuntu-on-acer-predator %}), the issues I've encountered and possible fixes, enjoy the reading!
